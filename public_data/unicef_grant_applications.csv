This selection is based on our past innovations such as VaccineLedger that have been reviewed by UNICEF. 
The VaccineLedger is a decentralized supply chain management platform for tracing vaccines from manufacture to last mile beneficiary.  VaccineLedger continues to play a crucial role in COVID-19 and other vaccine deliveries worldwide and was recognized by the United Nations as a Digital Public Good (DPG) in Aug 2022. StaTwig has also gained support from various governments and leading organizations such as World Economic Forum, Gavi, The Trinity Challenge, Techstars, Polygon and Protocol Labs.
If you’ve been looking for a way to make a positive impact with the resources at your disposal, this is it. Join Unicef and Gitcoin and help us bring better vaccines to the masses. The unborn generations of tomorrow are counting on it.

Lots of people are excluded from education, markets and the system at all. The serendipity of the governments make the conditions, at least, unpredictable so as to think even at a short term.
On the other hand, people have smartphones and the will to evolve. We took both facts and developed an opportunity to bring access leveraged on Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.
We built a secure and reliable wallet to encourage saving and investing. We built it open source to be absolutely transparent and traceable. We envision complete access to DeFi and Web3, as we may find a new path to create a lasting social and economic impact within Latam and the rest of the world.
It’s not only about what we envision, but it’s about what we have done already. First of all we have gathered a +35 passionate team about changing Latam’s reality in terms of access. Afterwards, we were able to create from scratch a self-custodial, multichain, open-source, mobile wallet that was recognized as a Digital Public Good.

We received the support and investment of Unicef Venture Fund, and with their support, we were able to be recognized by the DPG Alliance, being relevant to the UN sustainable development goals:
**SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere,
**SDG2: Zero hunger,
**SDG4: Quality education,
**SDG5: Gender equality,
**SDG10: Reduce inequalities
We care deeply about security, so we accomplished to certify ISO 27.001

In that wallet, we included an end to end solution that let people go from FIAT to the Metaverse and back, all at once. Started by moving the boundaries of education, by including gamified education in the wallet journey, also bringing people together and onboard.
We impacted more than 200,000 people within more than 80 countries all over the world.
We were born multi-chain (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB chain, RSK and Solana) as we want to take advantage of the different benefits of each network, and make them accessible for every human being. Also made DeFi investment products available, so as to give options to the lack of chances to safeguard capital in the middle of unstable countries and economies. All of that, a click away. Added to the gamified financial education module, a financial planner and a donation module to take full control of personal finances, and develop that way, a true culture of savings and wealth planning.
We are running the present grant to make come true the massive crypto adoption withing Latam. After listening to Vitalik's ""Ideas for things worth building"" in the EthMexico talk, we started working on Account Abstraction to simplify the wallet experience. Some time later we were invited by Unicef to participate in EthBogota and Devcon, where we worked together with the Ethereum Foundation Next Billion team on our proposal to achieve a smart wallet that abstracts accounts, social recovery, processes multiple transactions without gas costs.
We pursue to unlock the impact of Web3 on real problems that people come through on a daily basis. Hope to count with you to make this come true, at once, for real people to fulfill their personal dreams.

Kotani Pay provides full crypto wallet functionality on interfaces familiar to the African audience, and can be used on both feature phones and smartphones.

We are currently serving and offering financial inclusion to various populations including refugees, gig workers, local businesses, and farmers.

We have enabled refugees in Daadab and Kakuma UNHCR camps to receive an unconditional basic income from crypto philanthropists and non-governmental organizations, allowing many beneficiary families to meet their daily basic needs.

Many unemployed youth are unable to access work on international platforms due to the difficulty of cashing out their earnings as a majority of them do not have bank accounts or access to Paypal wallets. These youth can now work on microtask platforms and earn digital assets and utilize Kotani Pay to earn their dues directly to their mobile money wallets.
We are also running a De-Fi program to enable farmers and landowners to access low-interest loans and perform transparent and real-time transactions, with a very easy repayment schedule and process. This ensures that these farmers can access inputs and multiply their output and earnings, drastically improving livelihood and financial stability

The project leverages cutting-edge concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts to unlock new opportunities in financing forest conservation and rural development.

Treejer acts as a seamless, transparent bridge empowering local communities through crypto donations even in unbanked and remote areas. Treejer's approach incentivizes not only forest plantation but also conservation by locking up the funds in a smart contract and releasing it over time as planters and other data providers continue providing updates from forest status.

The protocol also provides proof-of-impact to donors in the form of dynamic tree NFTs that have real-world attributes. These NFTs are linked to each tree and are minted on Polygon network.

Treejer protocol has several smart contracts and two main interfaces: a payment and forest tracking interface offered to donors on ""https://treejer.com"" and a dedicated mobile app for tree planters and rural ambassadors. They use it to submit new trees, provide updates and unlock conservation rewards.

Besides using official interfaces, builders can integrate the tree planting plugin with their existing products.

In the Trombetas River basin, in the Para State of Northern Brazil, multispectral drone imagery and machine learning are utilized in tandem to track economically viable, non-timber species of trees (e.g., chestnut, copaiba, and Brazil nuts). In doing so, they seek to empower indigenous communities in the sustainable management, harvesting, and preservation of their natural resources while supplementing traditional modes of income generation in this region and cultivating local prosperity. First, Bioverse captured multispectral, high-resolution satellite imagery for a detailed picture of the forest canopy, and then they took high-resolution canopy images with drones. Lastly, they built a mobile application that provides in-hand Forest Abundance Maps to local communities using the data collected. Throughout this process, they've identified over 19,240 trees and completed machine learning training for brazil nuts and palm trees, with a 97% accuracy on ML models for the detection of Brazil Nut Trees. They work with locals to create an accompanying sustainable agro-forestry management plan and make their technology open source to maximize its potential reach and impact. The project was originally formed in 2017 during a Google- and NASA-sponsored Global Solutions Program at Singularity University. In the coming years, they intend to expand the application of their solutions to sustainable agriculture, invasive species detection and monitoring the environmental health of urban areas.",https://www.bioverselabs.com,Bioverse-Labs,BioverseLabs,
